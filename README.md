## Description of the web application

Our application is a whiteboard/brainstorming platform where teams can collaborate seamlessly in real-time.

The application will have all the features that a user might expect from a brainstorming platform, such as infinite canvas, mind-mapping, sticky notes, etc.

What makes StormAI unique is the AI integration. Every whiteboard in StormAI will contain an AI user which will assist you while you're brain storming. If the user needs suggestions, or is stuck on a problem, it can ask the AI and the AI will generate a tailored helpful response for the user.

Our API will also contain a paid tier which will allow the user to ask the AI to generate an image.

This platform will revolutionize the way teams collaborate, and brainstorm, as it would give them easy access to an AI which can answer virtually any questions they may have, and can draw out models of any product they want to visualize.
